            <h2>Brewser was born when three friends came together as a group for a project within their software development course. With a love for laughs, and a huge love for beer, they came together with an idea to re-imagine one of their favorite apps, but also develop an understanding for how full-stack web develop happens. Welcome to Brewser. Come for the beers, stay for the community.</h2>
