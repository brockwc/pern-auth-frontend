                BetterCupid was created to provide a neutral platform where people of all different 
                orientations, identities and backgrounds can find each other and make connections. 
                This isn't a site that's primarily for straight and cisgender individuals where LGBTQ+ 
                identities are tacked on as a feature after the fact, but it's also not specifically 
                for LGBTQ+ individuals either. With a wide variety of features and a modular approach 
                to design, we've got something for everyone.
